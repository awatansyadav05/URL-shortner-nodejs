<h1>URL Shortener</h1>
A simple URL shortener built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This application takes a long URL and generates a shorter, unique alias for it. Users can use these shortened URLs to easily share or access content. The app also keeps track of the original URLs, making it easy to retrieve them later.

<h2>Features </h2>

Redirect to the original URL when accessing the shortened link
Persistent storage with MongoDB for URL mappings
Minimal and efficient API design
